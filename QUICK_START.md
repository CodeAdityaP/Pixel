# Quick Start Guide - No Database Required

## üöÄ Run the Application (Frontend Only)

The Pixel e-commerce application works **completely without a database** for all frontend features!

### What Works Without Database:

‚úÖ **Product Browsing** - View all products  
‚úÖ **Shopping Cart** - Add/remove items, manage quantities  
‚úÖ **Wishlist** - Save favorite products  
‚úÖ **Product Search** - Real-time search functionality  
‚úÖ **Checkout Process** - Complete orders (stored locally)  
‚úÖ **Payment Gateway** - Test mode payment options  

### What's Not Available Without Database:

‚ùå User authentication/accounts  
‚ùå Order history in database  
‚ùå User profiles

## Quick Start (No Backend Required!)

### Option 1: Frontend Only

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done already)
npm install

# Start the frontend
npm run dev
```

That's it! Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

The app works using **localStorage** for:
- Shopping cart
- Wishlist  
- Order data

## What Happens During Checkout?

When you place an order **without database**:

1. ‚úÖ Cart items are processed
2. ‚úÖ Order number is generated (ORD-1234567890)
3. ‚úÖ Cart is cleared
4. ‚úÖ Success page is shown
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Order is NOT saved to database (only exists in browser)

**Note:** Orders are simulated. Perfect for demos and testing!
